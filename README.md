This repository contains two evidences for the Machine Learning module of the Artificial Intelligence and Data Science course.

The first evidence is a manual implementation of a linear regression with gradient descent seen in the Machine Learning module, without using any machine learning library or framework, or advanced statistics. The implementation is tested with the dataset "Boston Housing" and some predictions are made. 

The second evidence is the implementation of a Random Forest model using the one included in the Sklearn library. The goal is to demonstrate the knowledge of the framework and how to configure the algorithm. The implementation is tested with the dataset "Boston Housing" and some predictions are made.
