# ML-Method
This repository contains two evidences for the machine learning module of the artificial intelligence and data science course.

The first evidence is a manual implementation of a linear regression with gradient descent seen in the Machine Learning module, without using any machine learning library or framework, or advanced statistics. The implementation is tested with the dataset "Data Science Job Salaries" and some predictions are made.
